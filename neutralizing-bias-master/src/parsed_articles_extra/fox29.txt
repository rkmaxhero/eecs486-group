Mexican man convicted of killing his child to be deported after encountering ICE
DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin discusses the charges against an illegal immigrant suspected of murder, a report that more migrants are open to self-deportation and takeaways from Sec. Noem's visit to Latin America.
An illegal immigrant convicted of killing his own child is in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody after he encountered ICE officers in a Montana prison last month.
Carlos Ambriz, a 53-year-old Mexican national, made contact with ICE officers while serving a 40-year sentence in the Montana State Prison for a deliberate homicide conviction and was served a notice to appear before an immigration judge.
He was arrested near his residence in Catoosa, Oklahoma, on March 25, ICE said.
Josh Johnson, acting director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Dallas Field Office, said Ambriz poses a "significant danger" to the community, especially because he was convicted of killing his own child.
"This subjectâ€™s criminal record underscores the significant danger he represents to our community, particularly with the serious charge and conviction for killing his own child," Johnson said.
"Our officers remain committed to enhancing public safety by apprehending and removing criminal aliens who violate immigration laws."
Carlos Ambriz, 53, was arrested in Oklahoma on March 15, ICE said.
Ambriz will remain in ICE custody until he is sent back to Mexico, and his upcoming deportation will not be his first.
He was ordered removed on July 3, 1999, by an immigration judge near Seattle, Washington.
