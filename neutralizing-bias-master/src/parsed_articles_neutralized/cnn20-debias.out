trump \xe2\x80\x99 s immigration crack model is hitting modelo and corona sales , ceo says
president donald trump \xe2\x80\x99 s deportation push is spooking latino customers and hurting beer sales , according to modelo and corona owner constellation brands .
since taking office , trump and his team have enacted measures to crack down on immigration , including invoking a rarely used wartime authority .
the trump administration has made some missteps in recent weeks , including deporting a salvadoran man .
about half of constellation \xe2\x80\x99 s us customers are hispanic , and some have stopped going out to restaurants and gathering in large groups out of fear of being swept up in deportations , constellation brands \xe2\x80\x99 william newlands said on a conference call with analysts thursday .
a lot of consumers in the hispanic community are concerned right now , \xe2\x80\x9d he said .
\xe2\x80\x9c social gatherings , an area where the hispanic consumer often consumes beer , are declining today as part of these concerns that they have .
that model contributed to a 1 % drop in constellation \xe2\x80\x99 s beer shipments last quarter .
constellation said that the slowdown in beer sales was most pronounced at retailers in neighborhoods with large hispanic populations .
in an interview with the wall street journal , newlands some latino shoppers are shifting their shopping to large retail chains in an attempt to blend into a crowd .
that means they are no longer frequenting smaller convenience stores or bodegas that primarily serve hispanic consumers .
trump \xe2\x80\x99 s immigration policies are another source of pressure on companies , in addition to tariffs that caused economic turmoil and threaten a recession .
burlington , foot locker , colgate - palmolive , and monster have all noted sluggish sales among hispanic customers in recent weeks .
\xe2\x80\x9c there is an impact on hispanic demand , as we \xe2\x80\x99 ve seen , lower traffic from hispanic consumers , \xe2\x80\x9d colgate - palmolive vice president john faucher said at a conference last month .
so far this year , discretionary purchases among hispanic consumers have fallen at a faster than non - hispanic customers , according to market research firm circana .
a \xe2\x80\x9c consistent theme we have heard over the last several months has been mounting pressure among [ hispanic consumers ] stemming from concerns on immigration policy , nik modi , an analyst at rbc capital markets , said in a note to clients last week .
this has manifested in pull back from retail .
