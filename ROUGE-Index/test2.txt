Ryan Knutson: When President Trump was on the campaign trail, he made a lofty promise. He said he was going to deport millions of illegal immigrants.

President Trump: And on day one, we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.

Ryan Knutson: And specifically, he said he was going to deport immigrants who had committed crimes.

President Trump: We are going to crack down on the gangs, the drug dealers, human traffickers, and criminal cartels.

Michelle Hackman: And I think the way that it was portrayed was, we're going to go after people who knowingly came here illegally, knowingly broke our laws. And so I think a lot of people were led to believe that that is what the crackdown was going to look like. And now it looks really different.

Ryan Knutson: That's our colleague, Michelle Hackman, who covers immigration. And she says that since Trump took office, the mass deportations have not yet been as mass as he promised.

Michelle Hackman: His mass deportation isn't going so well so far, and that's a huge source of frustration for Trump, for people in his administration. Deportations actually aren't that much higher than they were under Biden.

Ryan Knutson: So to increase the number of deportations, the Trump administration is targeting a new group of people, people who came to the United States legally under certain programs.

Michelle Hackman: They're broadening the aperture of who we would think of as deportable. So it's a whole new scale that we're seeing.

Ryan Knutson: Welcome to The Journal, our show about money, business, and power. I'm Ryan Knutson. It's Wednesday, March 19th. Coming up on the show, a new phase in Trump's immigration fight. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has been turning up the heat on deportations. Over the weekend, his administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans without giving them hearings, citing an 18th century law. He's also been expanding the list of who is deportable by going after people with a variety of legal statuses, including some with green cards or visas. As part of that expansion, the administration is targeting an obscure program known as humanitarian parole. Humanitarian parole is a part of immigration law that's historically been used for special situations when someone can't get a visa.

Michelle Hackman: And so the government says, okay, this is an extraordinary circumstance. We're going for humanitarian reasons, let you into the country temporarily on this thing called parole.

Ryan Knutson: So the idea is kind of like the U.S. will let in some people under certain circumstances out of the kindness of America's heart, but it's only supposed to be temporary.

Michelle Hackman: The idea is it's supposed to be temporary, but it does, I want to emphasize, really give the government very broad authority to let people in as long as they can say that there's some kind of either humanitarian or public benefit reason to let someone in.

Ryan Knutson: Humanitarian parole has also been used during emergency evacuations, like after the Vietnam War and after the U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan. But humanitarian parole really expanded under the Biden administration, specifically after Russia invaded Ukraine.
