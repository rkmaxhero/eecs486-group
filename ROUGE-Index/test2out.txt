President Trump made a promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants, including those who had committed crimes. However, Michelle Hackman, an immigration expert, reveals that mass deportations have not been as successful as he promised. Deportations are not as high as they were under Biden, and the Trump administration is targeting a new group of people who came to the US legally under certain programs.

The Trump administration has been increasing the heat on deportations, deporting hundreds of Venezuelans without giving them hearings, citing an 18th-century law. They are also expanding the list of deportable individuals by targeting people with various legal statuses, including some with green cards or visas. As part of this expansion, the administration is targeting the obscure program known as humanitarian parole.

Humanitarian parole is a part of immigration law that has historically been used for special situations when someone cannot get a visa. The government allows people to enter the country temporarily on humanitarian parole, but it is only temporary. The idea is that the U.S. will let in some people under certain circumstances out of the kindness of America's heart, but it is only temporary. Humanitarian parole has also been used during emergency evacuations, like after the Vietnam War and after the U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan.
