border c tom homan discusses comments from former homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas on sanctuary cities and what he would have done differently in the biden administration .
the number of immigrants the u . s . is estimated to have surged to more than 18 million after the biden - era border crisis , according to a new research report by a immigration group , which also found an 11 % increase in less than two years .
the report was produced by the federation for american immigration reform ( fair ) , which argues for lower levels of immigration overall .
it estimates that , as of march 2025 , there are approximately 18 . 6 million immigrants living in the u . s .
that is 11 % higher than an estimate the group published injune 2023 , when it found that there were 16 . 8 million immigrants .
overall , it estimates that the population has grown by 4 . 1 million or 28 . 2 % since december 2020 .
" as of 2025 , american population growth comes almost entirely from high levels of immigration , both legal and illegal , " the report says .
estimates that there were around 11 . 7 million illegal immigrants in 2013 .
the group includes , as an illegal immigrant , anyone who does not have legal status like a visa or permanent residency , and also includes those who may be in the country illegally but given a lawful presence , like temporary protected status or humanitarian parole .
the biden administration expanded the use ofhumanitarian paroleas a way to curb skyrocketing illegal border crossings .
it allowed migrants to cross the border after scheduling an appointment on the cbp one app for parole , and had parole programs where migrants could fly in having obtained travel authorization .
fair argues that even though they are described as having a " lawful presence , " they do not have legal status and therefore can not be counted as being in the country legally .
" counting individuals in these situations as \xe2\x80\x98 legal immigrants \xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98 lawful residents \xe2\x80\x99 would be both incorrect and a mischaracterization of immigration law , " the group argues .
the report estimates the total number of illegal immigrants by using census data and compensating for what it argues is a history of undercounting those who arrive illegally , calculating an undercount of around 40 % .
the report also states that " estimating the size , distribution , and characteristics of the illegal alien population is an inexact science . "
" in truth , we do not know exactly how many people cross the border illegally and evade immigration authorities , nor can anyone quantify overstays or gotaways .
we can only estimate these figures based on annual and monthly census data , " the report .
it argues that key factors driving the surge in numbers were biden - era policies , including at the border , the release of migrants into the u . s . and what it claims was an " abuse " of parole authority .
the trump administration , which took office in january , has reversed an of biden policiesand has shut down the parole policies and the use of the cbp one app .
it has also launched a mass deportation campaign in the interior , while also deploying the military to the border and declaring a national emergency .
the administration has since been touting a drop in numbers at the border .
in february , there were 8 , 326 southern border encounters , down from 189 , 913 in february 2024 .
the administration has so far removed more than 55 , 000 undocumented immigrants from the u . s .
" within hours of taking the oath of office , i declared a national emergency on ours borderand i deployed the u . s . military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our country .
as a result , illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded , ever , " president donald trump said on tuesday .
" they heard my words , and they chose not to come . "
