the latest on trump \xe2\x80\x99 s trade war and immigration
\xe2\x80\x9c the federal courts have no authority to direct the executive branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way , or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner , \xe2\x80\x9d the doj attorneys wrote in the seven - page filing , arguing officials have a duty only to \xe2\x80\x9c remove any domestic obstacles \xe2\x80\x9d that may stand in the way of abrego garcia returning to the us .
an earlier \xe2\x80\x94 yet similar \xe2\x80\x94 order from xinis was appealed by the government up to the supreme court , which ultimately backed the judge \xe2\x80\x99 s order thursday .
the high court , however , did not give the administration a deadline for when abrego garcia should be returned , saying instead that the district judge \xe2\x80\x99 s directive was unclear and needed clarification .
the supreme court said that the clarification needed to be made with \xe2\x80\x9c due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs .
the administration , the justice department lawyers wrote in the sunday filing , \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98 facilitate \xe2\x80\x99 to mean what that term has long meant in the immigration context , namely actions allowing an alien to enter the united states .
\xe2\x80\x9c taking \xe2\x80\x98 all available steps to facilitate \xe2\x80\x99 the return of abrego garcia is thus best read as taking all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien \xe2\x80\x99 s ability to return here , \xe2\x80\x9d they continued .
\xe2\x80\x9c indeed , no other reading of \xe2\x80\x98 facilitate \xe2\x80\x99 is tenable \xe2\x80\x94 or constitutional \xe2\x80\x94 here .
in a separate court filing sunday , a senior immigration and customs enforcement official said in a sworn statement that abrego garcia \xe2\x80\x9c is no longer eligible for withholding of removal \xe2\x80\x9d because of the administration \xe2\x80\x99 s claim that he \xe2\x80\x99 s a member of the ms - 13 gang , which the trump administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization .

abrego garcia was granted status by an immigration judge in 2019 that prohibited the federal government from sending him to el salvador .
his attorneys claim he fled gang violence in el salvador more than a decade ago .
under the 2019 order , he was still considered removable ; it could be to el salvador .
but the assertion by evan katz , an official with ice \xe2\x80\x99 s enforcement and removal operations , means that if abrego garcia were brought back to the us , the government would work quickly to deport him .
katz \xe2\x80\x99 s statement was filed as part of the justice department \xe2\x80\x99 s daily update on what the administration is doing to facilitate abrego garcia \xe2\x80\x99 s return .
xinis ordered the updates last week after a doj attorney could not provide details on his exact location .
the trump administration said in its saturday filing that abrego garcia is \xe2\x80\x9c alive and secure \xe2\x80\x9d in el salvador \xe2\x80\x99 s , cecot .
\xe2\x80\x9c it is my understanding based on official reporting from san salvador in san salvador that abrego garcia is currently being held in the terrorism confinement center in el salvador , \xe2\x80\x9d a senior state department official wrote in the filing .
he is alive and secure in that facility .
what \xe2\x80\x99 s next in the case of mahmoud khalil after immigration judge says he can be deported ?
while an immigration judge \xe2\x80\x99 s ruling that columbia university graduate mahmoud khalil \xe2\x80\x93 a legal permanent resident \xe2\x80\x93 can be deported a victory for the trump administration , the legal battle against his detention and deportation is far from over .
the decision by assistant chief immigration judge jamee comans in louisiana on friday came after the federal government submitted what it said was evidence alleging khalil \xe2\x80\x99 s \xe2\x80\x9c beliefs , statements or associations \xe2\x80\x9d made him .
the judge ruled the palestinian activist \xe2\x80\x99 s presence posed \xe2\x80\x9c potentially serious foreign policy consequences , \xe2\x80\x9d agreeing with a two - page memo from secretary of state marco rubio earlier in the week accusing khalil of undermining \xe2\x80\x9c u . s . policy to combat anti - semitism \xe2\x80\x9d without citing any allegations of criminal activity .
a \xe2\x80\x9c removability finding \xe2\x80\x9d in immigration court means the judge has determined the individual is subject to removal from the united states due to a violation of immigration law or lack of legal immigration status .
khalil \xe2\x80\x99 s attorneys said they will appeal .
a louisiana immigration judge mahmoud khalil can be deported be deported
\xe2\x80\x9c we do n \xe2\x80\x99 t think this is the final word at all , marc van der hout , an immigration attorney for khalil , told cnn after the ruling , referring in part to a separate legal challenge in federal court in new jersey on grounds that he is being targeted for constitutionally protected free speech .
khalil has separate court cases playing out in two states \xe2\x80\x93 the louisiana case is focused on his deportation order and the new jersey case is focused on his habeas petition challenging the legality of his detention .
immigration officers arrested khalil last month outside his columbia university apartment following a deportation order from the trump administration .
khalil , who is married to a us citizen , is a prominent palestinian activist who played a central role in protests against israel \xe2\x80\x99 s in gaza on the ivy league campus last year .
after his detention , khalil was flown by the government to an immigration detention center in louisiana .
the case has become a symbol of the trump administration \xe2\x80\x99 s on pro - choice protests on college campuses .
here \xe2\x80\x99 s a look at what could happen next :
khalil \xe2\x80\x99 s attorneys said they will challenge friday \xe2\x80\x99 s ruling before the board of immigration appeals , and will file an asylum case on his behalf .
\xe2\x80\x9c we move on now into what \xe2\x80\x99 s called the relief stage , where mahmoud can present certain applications to defend against removal , and we \xe2\x80\x99 re set to file additional evidence and applications by april 23 , \xe2\x80\x9d johnny sinodis , an immigration attorney for khalil , said friday .
\xe2\x80\x9c claiming that this case will require at least a few more hearings in immigration court before \xe2\x80\xa6 a final decision is made , at which point there could be appeals .
van der hout , in a conference call friday with a federal judge in the new jersey court where they \xe2\x80\x99 re also fighting for his release , said khalil will likely apply for asylum .

judge rules mahmoud khalil is removable \xe2\x80\x99 from the u . s .
\xe2\x80\x9c he is entitled to file for relief in the form of asylum withholding removal , \xe2\x80\x9d van der hout the judge .
\xe2\x80\x9c so nothing \xe2\x80\x99 s going to happen quickly in the immigration proceedings , even though she \xe2\x80\x99 s found him removable on the foreign policy ground .
the trump administration is attempting to limit asylum claims in the us , an effort that is also under litigation now .
aaron reichlin - melnick , a senior fellow at the american immigration council , an immigrant advocacy group , said on social media the decision on khalil \xe2\x80\x99 s application for relief from removal \xe2\x80\x93 whether granted or denied \xe2\x80\x93 will likely end up before the board of immigration appeals .
\xe2\x80\x9c neither the immigration judge nor the board of immigration appeals is authorized to hear his arguments that the trump ( administration ) is violating the first amendment here , \xe2\x80\x9d reichlin - melnick wrote on x .
if he loses at the bia , he can make those arguments to a federal circuit court on a second round of appeals .
khalil keeps his green card and n ca \xe2\x80\x99 t be deported , reichlin - melnick wrote , until he loses at the appeals board and his removal order becomes final .
newly - released memo from rubio details government \xe2\x80\x99 s only evidence in effort to deport mahmoud khalil
\xe2\x80\x9c the timeline depends entirely on whether he remains detained .
if , it could be 1 - 2 years until a circuit court weighs in .
if released , it could be 5 - 7 years , \xe2\x80\x9d reichlin - melnick wrote .
khalil \xe2\x80\x99 s legal team is reported to have been more immigration hearings will be held before a final decision is made , after which they can make an appeal to the board of immigration appeals .
\xe2\x80\x9c today , we saw our worst fears play out : mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process , a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing , and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent , \xe2\x80\x9d van der hout said in a statement .
khalil \xe2\x80\x99 s attorneys have filed multiple petitions challenging the legality of his arrest and detention before us district court judge michael farbiarz in new jersey , where khalil was detained before his transfer to an immigration and customs enforcement detention center in jena , louisiana .
farbiarz told attorneys in a phone conference friday he \xe2\x80\x99 s deciding whether he has the jurisdiction over the claims filed by khalil \xe2\x80\x99 s legal team \xe2\x80\x93 including a habeas corpus motion , one requesting his return to the new york area , and another asking for his release on bail .
the attorneys will continue to seek bail and a preliminary injunction that would release him from custody while his immigration case proceeds , according to the american civil liberties union .
\xe2\x80\x9c what happened in immigration court today only claims the need for the federal court to really intervene and make a decision in this case , because the immigration court made clear today that it wo n \xe2\x80\x99 t , and it believes it n \xe2\x80\x99 t , \xe2\x80\x9d aclu lawyer amy belsher , who is part of khalil \xe2\x80\x99 s legal team , said friday .
mahmoud khalil \xe2\x80\x99 s case to remain in new jersey after judge denies us government \xe2\x80\x99 s bid to move it
donna lieberman , the head of the new york civil liberties union , told cnn friday that khalil will get a hearing in new jersey .
\xe2\x80\x9c i think that the government was pretty clear that it wanted to get mahmoud khalil out of new york city , out of new jersey and into friendlier territory .
that \xe2\x80\x99 s why they spirited him off in the middle of the night to louisiana , \xe2\x80\x9d she said .
reichlin - melnick added on x : \xe2\x80\x9c the long story short ; the case is not remotely over yet .
there is still a long path forward through multiple different stages before the trump ( administration ) succeeds in stripping him of his green card .
