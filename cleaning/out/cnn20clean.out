How trump calling immigration an \xe2\x80\x98 invasion \xe2\x80\x99 could help him stretch the law
no longer campaign trail rhetoric, president Donald Trump \xe2\x80\x99 s insistence that immigration to the United States amounts to an \xe2\x80\x9c invasion \xe2\x80\x9d may be critical to unlocking extraordinary powers as the administration carries out his deportation agenda.
Multiple executive orders and agency memos use the word \xe2\x80\x9c invasion \xe2\x80\x9d to describe why Trump is taking actions that tighten the US border, empower state and local officials to carry out immigration enforcement, and take a more aggressive approach to detaining and deporting migrants.
The word choice is intentional.
Trump \xe2\x80\x99 s executive Trump
legal experts believe the administration could try to rely on the invasion rationale to justify possible future actions that would go beyond the limits of immigration law and that would ignore the procedures in place for border - crossers.
\xe2\x80\x9c the invasion point comes in here, because the most basic and longstanding purpose to having a military is to stop people from invading the country.
And that \xe2\x80\x99 s what \xe2\x80\x99 s happening at the southern border, \xe2\x80\x9d ken cuccinelli, who served as the acting deputy secretary of homeland security in the first Trump administration.
The president the current states state does n need anything beyond his commander in chief authority to block people from crossing the border illegally.
It also previews how the justice department will defend his immigration agenda in court, hoping to capitalize on how courts have historically deferred to a president \xe2\x80\x99 s actions in instances of a national emergency.
\xe2\x80\x9c he is trying to invoke a fiction in order to increase the power of the president in ways that are completely inapplicable to this situation, \xe2\x80\x9d said Lucas gutting, a Stanford law professor who founded the American civil LIBerries union \xe2\x80\x99 s immigrants \xe2\x80\x99 rights project and who served in top roles in democratic administration.
The language to constitutional provisions that give federal government and states special powers in times of invasion.
The possible invocation of the 1798 alien enemies act is also hanging over how trump \xe2\x80\x99 s anti-immigration agenda is being framed so far.
That law, which trump rejected on the campaign trail, allows the federal government to depart from the usual procedures for detentions and deportations in a time of \xe2\x80\x9c invasion or predatory incursion.
\xe2\x80\x9c we are not there yet, \xe2\x80\x9d Steve Vladek, a CNN supreme court analyst and Georgetown university law center professor, but, \xe2\x80\x9c we may well be in for a very, very big, pitched legal battle over whether there really is an invasion along the southern border and what the legal consequences are of that are.
In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that \xe2\x80\x9c tens of millions of unnetted illegal migrants and tons of illicit drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine poured over the southern border into American communities over the last four years.
\xe2\x80\x9c that is an invasion, and the American people recognize that this the reality \xe2\x80\x93 that \xe2\x80\x99 s why they delivered a mandate to President Trump to secure our border and communities, \xe2\x80\x9d Desai said.
The embrace of the invasion idea picks up on claims that states like Texas were making in legal disputes with the Biden administration over what role they could play in policing the border.
In addition to the constitution \xe2\x80\x99 s guarantee that the federal government shall protect states from invasion, another provision allows states to engage in war when they are \xe2\x80\x9c actually invaded.
\xe2\x80\x9c when you put those two things together, what do you get ?
If a president declares an invasion, a state can engage in war.
The argument could allow states to take actions that federal law would normally foreclose, Blackman said, but the proposition will have to be tested in court.
\xe2\x80\x9c it \xe2\x80\x99 s significant constitutional power that has n t really been discussed at all, Blackman said.
The administration has emphasized it \xe2\x80\x99 s looking for help from the states in its efforts to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants.
Last week, then - acting homeland security secretary released a memo, pivoting off of trump \xe2\x80\x99 s executive orders, that made a finding of a \xe2\x80\x9c mass influx \xe2\x80\x9d of migrants to trigger new state authorities for immigration enforcement.
According to Vladek, the administration \xe2\x80\x99 s use of such language gives \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x9d to state officials like Texas gov. Greg Abbott who have sought for their states to take a more direct role in immigration enforcement.
Texas, for instance, has used the \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x9d rationale in court to defend a state law, challenged by the Biden administration, that allows state officials to arrest and detain people suspected of entering the country illegally.
Legal experts see the invasion motif as a signal for powers that Trump administration may seek to exercise to take his anti-immigration agenda even further and to overcome laws imposed by congress that traditionally dictate border policy.
Ilya so min, a professor of law at George mason university, pointed to past instances where courts struck down attempts to end all asylum procedures at the border, concluding such moves as violations of the refugee act.
Part of the purpose of the invasion argument is they say, \xe2\x80\x98 well, that overrides statutory constraints that congress might otherwise put in place, \xe2\x80\x99 so min said.
The invasion language could also be \xe2\x80\x9c setting the stage \xe2\x80\x9d for invocation of the alien enemies act, Vladek said, referring to tHe 1798 statute last used during World War ii that would let the government eschew the process protections afforded to immigrants before they can be deported.
The law was referenced in a Trump executive order last week that designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.
What is ice, and how are its priorities changing ?
Already, Trump is repeating a used in his first administration to get around the congressional appropriations process.
With another measure signed last week, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, in effort to direct military resources towards border security.
Trump faced lawsuits when he used a similar maneuver during his first term to funnel defense department funding towards building a border wall.
Courts may be more willing to defer to this kind of than other trump efforts to get around federal law, said Matthew Lindsay, a university of Baltimore school professor.
He noted, however, that the immigration crisis is not what it was 2023 in, as the numbers of border crossing have dropped considerably since that highpoint.
\xe2\x80\x9c lurking behind this, there is a separation of powers question about what extent courts are going to be keeping congress involved in the types of appropriations decisions congress passes, \xe2\x80\x9d he said.
A key question underlying trump \xe2\x80\x99 s strategy will be whether courts believe they can review a president \xe2\x80\x99 s determination that an influx of migrants can qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9c invasion \xe2\x80\x9d or if they see that as the type of \xe2\x80\x9c political question \xe2\x80\x9d they have no power to decide.
If they chose the latter course, \xe2\x80\x9c that would give the president a blank check to declare an invasion pretty much anytime he wants, and then use that to suspend everyone \xe2\x80\x99 s civil liberties, \xe2\x80\x9d so min said.
One judge has recently floated the idea.
In a 5th US circuit court of appeals ruling last summer siding WIth texas in a dispute with the biden administration over buoys the state placed in the rio grande , judge james ho wrote a partial dissent that seemed to embrace an invasion justification being put forward by the state , while describing the invasion determination as a political question that was not up courts to decide .
judge blocks trump \xe2\x80\x99 s \xe2\x80\x98 unconstitutional \xe2\x80\x99 executive order that aims to end birthright citizenship
\xe2\x80\x9c ho is the only federal judge , of the ones who have considered the issue , to have some extent , at least , endorsed the invasion argument , somin said .
everyone else has rejected it .
ho , seen as on the shortlist for possible supreme court nominees if trump is given an opening on the high court , also recently floated the idea as a possible exception to the principle of birthright citizenship , which trump is trying to end for children born to undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders .
supporters of trump \xe2\x80\x99 s agenda are confident courts will defer to his determination that an invasion is occurring at the southern border .
other legal experts who are more skeptical say the context in which he is making the argument will likely matter a great deal .
\xe2\x80\x9c it may just depend on their appetite for just standing by and allowing the administration to accumulate these instances of unchecked authority , lindsay said .
