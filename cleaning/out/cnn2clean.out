Tufts university student details in ice detention ahead of Monday hearing
a federal judge in Vermont will hear arguments Monday on the legality of Dumas Turk \xe2\x80\x99 s detention at a Louisiana immigration facility the tufts' university PhD student as \xe2\x80\x9c unsanitary, unsafe, and inhumane.
The hearing for Turk \xe2\x80\x93 whom the US government has accused of being \xe2\x80\x9c engaged in activities in support of Hamas \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 comes as the Washington Post reports a state department office failed to find evidence tying her to antisemitism or terrorism just days before she was arrested by immigration and customs enforcement.
The finding was detailed last month in a memo that does not name the state department office involved, the Washington Post report says.
Besides pointing to the lack of evidence against Turk, the memo her name was not associated with any terrorism - related information during a search of us government databases, according to the post, citing government officials briefed on the memo.
The 30 - year - old former Fulbright scholar, who \xe2\x80\x99 s originally from Turkey and has been in the US on an f - 1 student visa, was detained nearly three weeks by masked officers near her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts.
The government has not specified what the activities \xe2\x80\x9c in support of Hamas \xe2\x80\x9d were.
Her lawyers say she is being punished for speaking out in favor of Palestinian rights.
Turk is one of several international university students facing deportation as the Trump administration takes aim at pro-choice protesters and activists on college campuses.
The arrests of scholars and students at the hands of law enforcement officers \xe2\x80\x93 who have taken them into custody by ambushing them on city streets and near their homes \xe2\x80\x93 have sent a chill across the international student community.
The department of homeland security originally asked the StAte department to cancel Turk \xe2\x80\x99 s visa under a legal authority meant to safeguard us foreign policy interests, according to the Washington Post, but the state department memo said Secretary of State Marco Rubio lacked the grounds to do that.
The state department said the visa could still be revoked without using that particular legal authority because the immigration and nationality act gives the Secretary of State complete discretion to do so.
CNN reached out to DHS and the state department for comment on the Washington Post report.
After her arrest, Turk was shuttled through four states and an asthma attack before ending up at the south Louisiana ice processing center in Basil \xe2\x80\x93 more than 1, 500 miles away from home.
on Monday \xe2\x80\x99 s hearing, her attorneys are asking Vermont district judge William k. Sessions iii to rule that the Vermont district court is the appropriate venue to hear the case since it \xe2\x80\x99 s the last place she was taken before a final transfer to Louisiana.
They have also asked for Turk to be immediately released, saying that it is not a flight risk or danger to the community, and she lacked access to asthma medicine in detention.
Turk had four asthma attacks while in custody, according to her written declaration filed Thursday.
The Trump administration argued the federal district judge has no authority to consider a challenge to the government \xe2\x80\x99 s effort to deport Turk.
