Trump \xe2\x80\x99 s immigration crack model is hitting model and corona sales, CEO says
president Donald Trump \xe2\x80\x99 s deportation push is spooking Latino customers and hurting beer sales, according to model and corona owner constellation brands.
Since taking office, Trump and his team have enacted measures to crack down on immigration, including invoking a rarely used wartime authority.
The Trump administration has made some missteps in recent weeks, including deporting a Salvadoran man.
About half of constellation \xe2\x80\x99 s us customers are Hispanic, and some have stopped going out to restaurants and gathering in large groups out of fear of being swept up in deportations, constellation brands \xe2\x80\x99 William Newlands said on a conference call with analysts Thursday.
A lot of consumers in the Hispanic community are concerned right now, \xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9c social gatherings, an area where the Hispanic consumer often consumes beer, are declining today as part of these concerns that they have.
That model contributed to a 1 % drop in constellation \xe2\x80\x99 s beer shipments last quarter.
Constellation said that the slowdown in beer sales was most pronounced at retailers in neighborhoods with large Hispanic populations.
In an interview with the Wall Street journal, Newlands some Latino shoppers are shifting their shopping to large retail chains in an attempt to blend into a crowd.
That means they are no longer frequenting smaller convenience stores or bodegas that primarily serve Hispanic consumers.
Trump \xe2\x80\x99 s immigration policies are another source of pressure on companies, in addition to tariffs that caused economic turmoil and threaten a recession.
Burlington, Foot Locker, Colgate - Palmolive, and monster have all noted sluggish sales among Hispanic customers in recent weeks.
\xe2\x80\x9c there is an impact on Hispanic demand, as we \xe2\x80\x99 VE seen, lower traffic from Hispanic consumers, \xe2\x80\x9d Colgate - Palmolive vice president john gaucher said at a conference last month.
So far this year, discretionary purchases among Hispanic consumers have fallen at a faster than non - Hispanic customers, according to market research firm circana.
A \xe2\x80\x9c consistent theme we have heard over the last several months has been mounting pressure among [ Hispanic consumers ] stemming from concerns on immigration policy, Nick mode, an analyst at RBC capital markets, said in a note to clients last week.
This has manifested in pull back from retail.
