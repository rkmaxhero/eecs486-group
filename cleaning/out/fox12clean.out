Florida attorney general jams upstair it is his goal to make Florida the safest state in the nation, with immigration being the top concern.
One of the youngest attorneys general in Florida \xe2\x80\x99 s history, upstair illegal immigration has taken a toll on his state.
" We \' ve also seen significant harms to our economy, where people [ are ] unlawfully here in this state, our taxing, our infrastructure, our education systems, and our healthcare systems.
So we believe in rule of law, " upstair said.
" Don \' t believe in sovereignty.
We want to make sure that the state of Florida is protecting families against the dangers of Illegal immigration and all the other vices and criminalities that go along with it. "
Most of the time under former president Joe Biden \xe2\x80\x99 administration, upstair said, illegal immigrants had committed crimes and were still released.
" Floridians have been seriously impacted by the immigration crisis, " he added.
" Over the last calendar year, we \' ve had dozens of serious crimes ranging from murder to sexual assaults of seniors, of children, and other serious felonies, " the Florida attorney general said.
" And in almost all cases, these criminals have been in touch with criminal justice system.
And when they were handed over to the feds, the Biden administration and the democrats just opened up the back door and let them back out on the streets, putting families in jeopardy. "
Fox News digital reached out to a representative for comment.
Upstair said that he is" excited" that this is no longer the case under trump \xe2\x80\x99 s administration.
" We \' ve given more powers to the state and to the governor where if local officials want to prevent law enforcement from working with the federal government to combat illegal immigration, that we can bring civil actions and levy penalties against these jurisdictions, " upstair said.
" And the governor ultimately has broader authority to remove people from office that do n \' t want to do their job. "
If they refuse, they are put" on notice. "
" the city of Fort Myers was the first to reverse and say, \xe2\x80\x98 okay, you know, we \' re going to help our law enforcement officers to cooperate, \'" upstair said.
Recently, several Fort Myers, Florida, city council members were in tears during a March 20 meeting leading up to the vote on the partnership between ice and their local police working together to apprehend illegal immigrants.

Bonk voted against the.
Fort Myers mayor Kevin Anderson was" disappointed" and" embarrassed" by the council members \' opposition to the vote, which resulted in a tie.
The Fort Myers city council Lateran passed the measure unanimously.
" I know Jacksonville recently decided to support this law, " upstair said.
" I know some others are \xe2\x80\x98 talking the talk \xe2\x80\x99 that they might not cooperate, but we will ensure that they are held accountable. "
Another priority for upstair in making Florida a safe place to raise a family is combating the sexual abuse of children.
" My first day on the job, I told our team, I want to do everything I can to prioritize getting these individuals off the streets, " upstair said.
" Somebody \' s trying to prey upon kids through social media, which is prevalent.
If people are trying to traffic our kids, if people are trying to engage in the sale of child pornography, we are going to go after them with the full force of law, and I hope these individuals do n \' t see the sunlight ever again. "
He said a recent bust of an international child pornography ring was especially.
" They were selling over a million videos and images, " upstair said.
" Words in the English language can not describe the nature of the sexual assault that was going on, hurting kids and babies in these images. "
" we busted this ring, " upstair said.
" We \' re continuing to investigate.
Anybody that \' s engaged in this type of behavior is going to face the full force of the law in Florida and my office \' s wrath. "
The father of three Florida will not be" lenient at all" in prosecuting child sex offenders, adding, " we \' re going to protect our kids and we \' re gonna keep our state safe, strong and free. "
In terms of making Florida a fair state to lI've in, upstair said that his team is fighting against prosecution of innocent people.
" Our office is going to fight back against lawfare and the dangers that it presents, " upstair said.
" We have filed many briefs in federal court to defend the actions of President Trump, to defend his ability to fire senior ranking officials in the administration that do n \' t want to do their jobs, that do n \' t want to adhere to his mission. "
He added that he thinks it \xe2\x80\x99 s" ridiculous" that the courts can keep the President of the United States from firing.
" We also have disagreed with the efforts of district judges across the country to try to impose their own political preferences for the executive power decisions of the president that the constitution, you know, clearly delineates fall with the president, " upstair said.
" Here at the local level, where we \' ve had state attorneys in Orlando and other jurisdictions that do n \' t want to impose sentences, that do n \' t want to bring cases against serious offenders, including murderers, we hold them accountable.
We take action.
I \' m going to be including my oversight authority to ensure that cases get brought where needed. "
The end result, he hopes to be a thriving place for families.
" Here in Florida, we \' re at a 50 - year crime low, " upstair said.
" That \' s not going to stop.
And under my watch as attorney general, that \' s never going to change. "
